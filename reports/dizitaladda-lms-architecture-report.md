# DizitalAdda / IEM LMS Production Architecture Report

Date: 30 June 2026

## Executive Summary

The current codebase is closer to an admissions Lead Management CRM than a complete Learning Management System. It has a useful Express/PostgreSQL backend foundation for leads, courses, departments, employees/counsellors, and partial authentication. The frontend is not yet a production application: one React tree contains a landing page and placeholder login, while another Vite client is still the starter template.

Production-ready major parts completed: 0 of 12.

Partially completed major parts: 5 of 12.

Major parts still left: 7 of 12.

Estimated production readiness:
- Admissions CRM: 25-30%
- Full LMS: 10-15%

## Current System Architecture

Frontend:
- React application in src/
- Routes currently include only landing page and login page
- Login page is placeholder only
- src/client is still the default Vite starter app

Backend:
- Node.js + Express.js
- Layered structure: routes -> controllers -> services -> repositories
- PostgreSQL access through pg Pool
- Modules present: auth, leads, courses, departments, employees/counsellors

Database:
- PostgreSQL is expected through environment variables
- No database migration files or schema files were found

Security:
- JWT middleware exists
- Role middleware exists
- These are not applied to active business routes
- Login does not issue a JWT yet

## Existing Backend Modules

Authentication:
- Register user exists
- Password hashing exists
- Login controller currently returns only "Login Working"
- JWT token creation is missing
- Refresh token/session strategy is missing

Lead Management:
- Lead create, list, detail, update, soft delete
- Lead status update
- Lead assignment to counsellor
- Search, filters, and pagination exist in repository
- Validation exists
- Production gaps remain around auth, audit, follow-up history, and imports

Course Management:
- Course create, list, detail, update, soft delete
- Search, filter, sort, pagination exist
- Basic validation exists for create
- Production gaps remain around update validation and department existence checks

Department Management:
- Create department
- List departments
- Duplicate name check exists
- Production gaps remain around update/delete, active status, validation

Employee/Counsellor Management:
- Create, list, detail, update, deactivate routes exist
- Creation is intended to create both user and employee records in a transaction
- Runtime bug exists: lastEmployee is referenced without being defined
- ApiError is used without import in employeeService

Dashboard:
- Route, controller, service, repository files exist but appear empty/commented out
- Dashboard route is not mounted

## Production-Level Target Architecture

Users
  -> React Admin/Web App
  -> CDN/Static Hosting
  -> HTTPS Load Balancer or Reverse Proxy
  -> Node.js Express API
      -> Auth and RBAC
      -> Lead Management
      -> Course/Department Management
      -> Employee/Counsellor Management
      -> Admission/Enrollment
      -> Student Management
      -> Payments/Fee Management
      -> Dashboard/Reports
      -> Notifications
      -> Audit Logs
  -> PostgreSQL
  -> Redis
      -> cache, rate limiting, queues
  -> Object Storage
      -> documents, receipts, course media
  -> Email/SMS/WhatsApp Gateway
  -> Monitoring and Logging
      -> API logs, metrics, error tracking
  -> CI/CD
      -> lint, tests, build, migrations, deployment

## Major Parts Status

1. Authentication and RBAC: Partial
2. User/Employee/Counsellor Management: Partial
3. Lead Management: Partial
4. Department Management: Partial
5. Course Management: Partial
6. Dashboard and Reports: Not complete
7. Admission/Enrollment Pipeline: Not complete
8. Student Management: Not complete
9. Fee/Payment Management: Not complete
10. Notifications/Follow-ups: Not complete
11. Frontend Admin Workspace: Not complete
12. Production Platform: Not complete

## Key Production Blockers

1. Authentication is incomplete.
Login does not validate credentials or return JWT tokens.

2. Routes are ordered incorrectly.
The error handler is mounted before /api/leads, so lead routes are placed after the final error middleware.

3. Employee creation has runtime bugs.
lastEmployee is referenced before declaration, and ApiError is used without import.

4. No database schema/migrations are present.
Production deployment needs reproducible schema creation and versioned migrations.

5. Frontend is not connected to backend.
There is no real login form, dashboard, lead table, course management screen, or admin workspace.

6. Auth middleware and role middleware are not protecting business routes.
Production APIs should enforce permissions by role.

7. No automated tests were found.
Critical backend flows should have service/API tests before production.

8. No production deployment configuration exists.
Missing Dockerfile, environment templates, CI/CD pipeline, logging, monitoring, and backup plan.

## Recommended Production Roadmap

Phase 1: Stabilize backend foundation
- Fix route order
- Complete login with JWT
- Apply auth and role middleware
- Fix employee creation bugs
- Add central validation/error handling consistency
- Add migrations and seed files

Phase 2: Complete CRM workflows
- Lead follow-up history
- Counsellor assignment rules
- Lead import/export
- Dashboard metrics
- Admission conversion workflow

Phase 3: Build frontend admin app
- Login page
- Protected routes
- Admin dashboard
- Lead list/detail/create/edit
- Course and department management
- Employee/counsellor management

Phase 4: Add LMS features if required
- Student profiles
- Enrollments
- Batches/classes
- Attendance
- Lessons/content
- Assignments/quizzes
- Certificates

Phase 5: Production hardening
- Tests
- Rate limiting
- Audit logs
- Monitoring
- CI/CD
- Backup and restore
- Docker/deployment configuration

## Final Assessment

The project has a good starting backend structure, but it is not production-ready yet. It currently represents a partially built admissions CRM foundation, not a complete production LMS. The most valuable next step is to stabilize backend authentication, route order, employee creation, migrations, and then build the real frontend admin workspace.

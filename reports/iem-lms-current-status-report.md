# IEM LMS Current Project Status Report

Date: 30 June 2026

## Short Answer

Project me abhi main kaam backend side par hua hai. Codebase ek complete LMS se zyada admissions Lead Management CRM foundation jaisa ban raha hai. Leads, courses, departments, employees/counsellors, auth middleware, validation, dashboard-style lead analytics, aur layered backend structure ka kaam present hai.

Frontend abhi mostly starter/placeholder state me hai. Real admin panel, real login flow, dashboard UI, lead table, course management screens, employee management screens, aur backend integration abhi complete nahi hai.

Estimated current readiness:
- Admissions CRM backend foundation: 35-45 percent
- Full production LMS: 10-15 percent
- Frontend production readiness: 5-10 percent

- Central response, error, async handler utilities present hain.
- Constants folder me HTTP status, messages, lead constants add kiye gaye hain.

Authentication:
- User register flow present hai.
- Password hashing bcrypt se ho raha hai.
- JWT verify karne wala auth middleware present hai.
- Role middleware file bhi present hai.

Lead Management:

- Lead detail API present hai.
- Lead update API present hai.
- Lead soft delete present hai.
- Lead status update present hai.
- Lead priority update present hai.
- Lead follow-up date update present hai.
- Lead assign-to-counsellor flow present hai.
- Lead code auto generation present hai.
- Duplicate phone/email checks present hain.
- Lead validators present hain.

Lead Dashboard / Analytics:
- Total leads, new leads, contacted leads, follow-up leads, interested leads, admission done, lost leads count queries present hain.
- Today follow-ups API logic present hai.
- Recent leads API logic present hai.
- Status/source/priority/counsellor performance analytics queries present hain.

Course Management:
- Course routes, controller, service, repository files present hain.
- Course create/list/detail/update/soft delete type backend flow present hai.
- Course validator present hai.

Department Management:
- Department routes, controller, service, repository files present hain.
- Create/list type flow present hai.
- Duplicate department name check present hai.

Employee / Counsellor Management:
- Employee routes, controller, service, repository files present hain.
- Employee create/list/detail/update/deactivate style flow present hai.
- Employee creation user + employee record transaction ke through intended hai.
- Employee code generation utility present hai.

Frontend:
- React routing setup exists in src.
- Landing page and login page files present hain.
- Separate Vite client exists under src/client.
- src/client abhi Vite starter template jaisa hai with default React/Vite demo UI.

Reports:
- reports folder present hai.
- Architecture report markdown and PDF already generated hain.
- PDF generator script present hai.

## Important Problems Found

1. Login incomplete hai.
Auth controller ka login abhi sirf "Login Working" response deta hai. Actual email/password validation, JWT creation, user response, and error handling login route me connected nahi hai.

2. authService me ApiError import missing hai.
registerUser function ApiError use karta hai, but ApiError import nahi hai. Duplicate email path par runtime error aa sakta hai.

3. employeeService me bugs hain.
ApiError use ho raha hai but import missing hai. lastEmployee variable use ho raha hai but define nahi kiya gaya. getLastEmployeeRepository import hai but call nahi ho raha. Employee create API runtime par fail ho sakti hai.

4. Lead routes currently error handler ke baad mounted hain.
server/app.js me errorHandler mount hone ke baad /api/leads route mount hua hai. Express me error handler ideally sab routes ke baad last me hona chahiye. Is order ko fix karna zaroori hai.

5. Protected lead routes need valid JWT, but login JWT nahi deta.
Lead routes authMiddleware se protected hain. Since login token issue nahi karta, frontend/user ke liye protected lead APIs practically use karna difficult hai.

6. Dashboard module separate route commented hai.
Lead dashboard routes leadRoutes me present hain, but separate dashboardRoutes app.js me commented hai.

7. Database schema/migrations missing hain.
Tables expected hain: users, employees, leads, courses, departments etc. But reproducible SQL migration/schema files repo me nahi mile. Production or new setup ke liye ye blocker hai.

8. Frontend backend se connected nahi hai.
Real API calls, auth state, protected routes, dashboard UI, lead CRUD screens, course/department/employee screens abhi nahi bane.

9. Tests missing hain.
Automated tests nahi mile. Auth, leads, employees, and route ordering jaise critical flows ke tests needed hain.

10. Production setup missing hai.
Docker, env example, CI/CD, logging, rate limiting, monitoring, backup/restore plan, and deployment config missing hain.

## Current Backend API Areas

Auth:
- /api/auth register route likely present
- /api/auth login route present but incomplete

Courses:
- /api/courses routes present

Departments:
- /api/departments routes present

Employees:
- /api/employees routes present

Leads:
- /api/leads routes present but mounted after error handler currently
- Dashboard-style lead routes exist under /api/leads/dashboard...

## What This Project Currently Is

Current project ko abhi "IEM LMS" bol sakte hain, but practical code status ke hisaab se ye:
- A backend-heavy admissions CRM foundation hai
- Lead/counsellor/course/department modules ke saath
- Auth foundation partial hai
- LMS modules like students, enrollment, batches, classes, attendance, course content, assignments, certificates, payments are not complete or not present
- Frontend admin workspace abhi start stage me hai

## Recommended Next Steps

Priority 1: Backend ko run-stable banana
- server/app.js me lead routes ko error handler se pehle mount karo.
- authService me ApiError import fix karo.
- employeeService me ApiError import add karo.
- employeeService me lastEmployee fetch karo before generateCode.
- Login flow complete karo: find user, compare password, generate JWT, return token + user.

Priority 2: Database foundation
- SQL migrations/schema add karo.
- Seed data add karo for admin user, sample courses, departments.
- .env.example add karo.

Priority 3: Auth and RBAC
- JWT secret env mandatory banao.
- Business routes par role-based permissions apply karo.
- Admin/counsellor permissions define karo.

Priority 4: CRM frontend
- Real login page connect karo.
- Protected route wrapper banao.
- Dashboard page banao.
- Lead list/create/edit/detail screens banao.
- Course, department, employee management screens banao.

Priority 5: LMS expansion
- Student profiles
- Admission/enrollment workflow
- Fee/payment records
- Batches/classes
- Attendance
- Course content
- Assignments/quizzes
- Certificates

## Final Status

Project me kaam hua hai, especially backend architecture aur lead management area me. Lekin abhi ye production-ready LMS nahi hai. Sabse pehle backend ke runtime blockers aur login/JWT flow fix karna chahiye. Uske baad frontend admin panel banana sabse valuable next milestone hoga.
